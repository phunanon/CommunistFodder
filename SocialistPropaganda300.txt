What Socialism Advocates
========================

Primarily, socialism is critical of the private ownership of absentee property, and its inherent economic tribalism. We see those who own capital (the ‘means of production’) and have others use it (Bourgeoisie); those who own capital and use it themselves (Petite-Bourgeoisie); and those who own no capital, and use only others’ (Proletariat).
Example: someone owns two industrial machines. Unless they’re overly protective of their equipment, or rather dim-witted, they’d rent out at least one machine to those without. This makes them Bourgeois. By renting-out that second machine, they personally contribute nothing, and can control the relationship between a machine operator and their tools. They own that property in absentia; it would be acceptable if they were using the machines personally, but they don’t—they physically can’t.
A 1983 UK Govt. study found an average 26 minutes per hour across a wide range of industry was never paid back in wages. Subsequently, eight individuals own half of the world’s wealth. It was not from their sweat, but from economic control. It was not super-human abilities, but rabid delegation and exploitation. Permanently underpaying the workers results in the mathematic inability to purchase produce of the capitalist system—recession, debt and credit ensue. It’s farsical that we borrow our exploited money at interest to subsist.
We socialists say: hold all absentee property in common! Ensure your neighbour has their home, the workman their hammer, the farmer their sickle. Who else needs these than the workers themselves? Certainly not lazy Bourgeois owners—ownership for rent is illegitimate! Can these bloodsuckers compete with a democratic workers’ economy in full harmony?
Away with irrational and wasteful cock-fight markets, welcome rational competition and collaboration! Away with corrupt politicians, welcome people’s democracy!
You have nothing to lose but your chains. Workers of the world, unite!
