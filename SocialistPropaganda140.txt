What Socialism Advocates
========================

We disapprove of absentee property ownership.
Example: someone owns two industrial machines. Unless dim-witted, they rent out at least one, making them Bourgeois. Controlling the workmen-tools relationship, they own in absentia; unable to use multiple machines personally, contributing nothing.
UK 1983, 26 minutes average per hour was withheld from wages; eight people own half the world’s wealth. Not through sweat but delegation and exploitation. Permanently underpaying workers results in mathematic inability to purchase all produced. We borrow our exploited money as credit to subsist—farsical.
We say: all absentee property in common! Ensure people their homes, operators their machines, farmers their land. Who needs these than the workers? Not lazy Bourgeois owners—ownership for rent is illegitimate! Can these parasites compete with a workers’ economy?
Away, irrational cock-fight markets; welcome, rational competition and collaboration! Away, corrupt politics; welcome, people’s democracy!
