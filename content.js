<p>This online course is an easy-to-digest, complete-beginner's resource to anti-capitalism.</p>
<p>I have tried to write in simple English. Read each section in order.</p>
<p><b>Marxism</b> teaches about capitalism, and anti-capitalist analysis.</p>
<p><b>Revolution</b> teaches about anti-capitalist movements, and how to help.</p>

    { topic: "Marxism",       level: 0,  title: "Marxism Introduction", content: `
<p><b>Marxism</b> is an analysis of society and economy by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and others. Some conclusions of Marxism are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>World society is in conflict between the workers and the employers.</li>
    <li>World economy must be democratically controlled by all workers.</li>
    <li>World society must go through popular revolution, not voting, to reach socialism.</li>
    <li>World society must go through socialism before it reaches communism.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will learn why these are Marxism's conclusions throughout this course.</p>
<p>Marxism also shows why things have value in money, and how trade works.</p>
` },

    { topic: "Marxism",       level: 0,  title: "Capital", content: `
<p>The most important focus of Marxism is <b>capital</b>, and who owns it. Capital is anything with value for making products. These include the <u>materials, tools, buildings, and land</u>, used by workers.</p>
<p>For example, a taxi driver uses their car to drive passengers around a city. The taxi car is capital, because it is used to earn money.</p>
<p>Capital is sometimes called the <b>means of production,</b> because it helps to make products for sale.</p>
<p>Slaves are also capital, because no worker uses them like a tool, but they still create value.</p>
<p><b>Money</b> is what a bank or government gives to trade different products easier. When someone has money, it is like a ticket for already existing capital. Sometimes, a bank or government will pretend they have capital when they give you money, hoping they have the capital later.</p>
` },

    { topic: "Marxism",       level: 1,  title: "Personal/Private Property", content: `
<p>Capital is owned as property by a person or business in capitalism. However, Marxism instead sees property as two different types:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Private property</b>: owned to be used by others (workers), and maybe the owner too, to earn money.</li>
    <li><b>Personal property</b>: owned only to be used by the owner, or others for free when the owner says it is okay.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you own a bed, and only you sleep on it (or other people sleep on it for free), it is <u>personal</u> property. If you own a bed, and other people pay to sleep on it (like a hotel), it is <u>private</u> property.</p>
<p>For example, if you own 1 car, and only you use it, and maybe drive other people for free (or for some fuel money), it is <u>personal</u> property. If you own 10 cars, you do not use all the cars by yourself, and rent them to other people, making the cars <u>private</u> property.</p>
` },

    { topic: "Marxism",       level: 1,  title: "Economic Classes", content: `
<p>Remembering private/personal property, Marxism puts each person of the world into 3 classes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>One of the <b>Proletariat</b>: does not own the property they work with.</li>
    <li>One of the <b>Petite-Bourgeoisie</b>: does own all or some of the property they work with.</li>
    <li>One of the <b>Bourgeoisie</b>: owns property, but does not use it themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the <u>Proletariat</u> (a worker) could be a clothes maker in a factory. They are paid for their work, but they do not own the machines, materials, or land they use.</p>
<p>One of the <u>Petite-Bourgeoisie</u> could be a small shop owner. They buy and sell products, and own or rent the building, but they also work there, or a few people work together.</p>
<p>One of the <u>Bourgeoisie</u> (a capitalist) could be a landlord. They own a building and land, and rent it out. Usually they do not have to work.</p>
<p>There are two types of Bourgeoisie: industrial and financial.</p>
<hr>
<p>How to pronounce: proletariat (pro-lit-airy-at), petite (peh-teet), bourgeoisie (bor-jwaz-ee).</p>
<p>Adjectives: bourgeois (bor-jwaz), proletarian (pro-lit-airy-an), e.g. <i>bourgeois culture, proletarian revolution</i>.</p>
` },

    { topic: "Marxism",       level: 1,  title: "Profit: Industrial", content: `
<p><b>Profit</b> is the capital that capitalists take from production for themselves. The two different types of capitalist get profit differently.</p>
<p>The <b>industrial capitalist</b> owns capital, and their workers give labour, and so the capitalist owns the finished product. The worker will be paid a wage (decided when they start work) but the wage will never be the full value of the product or service.</p>
<p>Below shows how an <u>industrial capitalist</u> uses their capital and workers to get money:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>1. Production</th><td>Labour + Capital <big>&rarr;</big> Product</td></tr>
    <tr><th>2. Sale</th><td>Product sold at market value</td></tr>
    <tr><th>3. Payment</th><td>Of market value:<br>30%: wage <big>&rarr;</big> worker<br>70%: surplus <big>&rarr;</big> capitalist</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>4. Spending</b><br>of surplus<br>by capitalist</td><td>Buy new capital; Pay taxes, loans & rent<br>Pay managers, dividends<br>----<br>The rest is profit for the capitalist</td></tr>
</table>
<p>From this, we see that after the product is made, it is sold, and the value made from that sale is split. Some goes to wage, and the rest is called "surplus."</p>
<p>Surplus is used to buy more capital, such as materials or other services.</p>
<p>In 2017, the richest 1% of the world took 82% of new value made by workers (<a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressreleases/2018-01-22/richest-1-percent-bagged-82-percent-wealth-created-last-year">ref</a>). This shows surplus is very high.</p>
<p>Marxism calls this whole process <b>exploitation</b>.</p>
<hr>
<p>In Marxism, a sold product is usually called a <i>commodity</i>.

    { topic: "Marxism",       level: 1,  title: "Profit: Financial", content: `
<p>A <b>financial capitalist</b> gets surplus in a different way. They own a lot of capital, such as housing, land, heavy machines, and shares in business.</p>
<p>The first capital was taken with exploitation. When people (including industrial capitalists) do not have capital themselves, they will borrow from the financial capitalist. The capitalist is paid with <b>interest</b>, so they get more capital back than they gave.</p>
<p>A capitalist can be both <i>financial</i> and <i>industrial</i>.</p>
<p>Banks are financial capitalists. They get a profit by giving loans.</p>
` },

    { topic: "Marxism",       level: 1,  title: "Financial Crisis", content: `
<p>The way an industrial capitalist gets surplus, with exploitation, causes financial crises, like in 2008.</p>
<p>Because a worker is paid only some of the value they made, they cannot buy back everything they produced.</p>
<p>For example, if every person worked picking fruit - $20 of fruit picked per hour - but they were paid only $10 per hour, they could only buy half of what they produced.</p>
<p>Capitalists do not fix this (by exploiting less) because they all want to exploit a big surplus for themselves. This problem is fixed often by fast spending, and fast growth.</p>
<p>It is also slightly fixed by giving loans, mortgages, and credit to workers so they can still buy without money.</p>
<p>However, it can go wrong: if surplus is invested in long-term capital, such as housing, the workers do not have the money to buy from the market. This causes a crash in prices.</p>

#Steve owns a laptop, and lets others work on it for $1 an hour. What <u>type of property</u> is the laptop?
Private: Correct! Even though Steve does not pay wages, he is still making a surplus from the work of others.; Personal: Try again. Steve might use the laptop himself, but that is not all.

    { topic: "Marxism",       level: 0,  title: "Class Conflict", content: `
<p>Marxism finds that <u>society is constantly in conflict, between the Proletariat and Bourgeoisie</u>.</p>
<p>They have different interests. First, the Proletariat want to increase wages, the Bourgeoisie want to decrease wages.</p>
<p>The Bourgeoisie always want to increase profit. However, the Bourgeoisie are also in conflict with each other. Not only in a market, but politically.</p>
<p>Socialism is the ultimate fight against the Bourgeoisie and their interests.</p>
` },

    { topic: "Marxism",       level: 1,  title: "Shareholding", content: `
<p>Shareholding is where someone owns <b>shares</b>/<b>stock</b> of a corporation. A share is a legal contract, saying the owner can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>... <b>vote</b> for new directors. A corporation is run by a <i>board of directors</i>.</li>
    <li>... take <b>dividends</b>, which is surplus the directors choose to give out each quarter of a year.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually, it is <u>one vote per share</u>, and <u>one portion of dividend per share</u>, not per shareholder. A shareholder with 100 shares gets 100 votes, and 100 worth of dividends. Therefore, shareholders with the most shares are given the most power and surplus.</p>
<p>Shares/stock are sold in stock markets. The price is how good the corporation is, and how many dividends it pays.</p>
<p>The problem is shareholders want big surplus. This means lowering wages, lowering safety, and increasing hours. It will also reduce costs, but workers do this anyway.</p>
<br>
<p>Most shareholders are Bourgeois - they 'own' private property by voting for directors. A corporation can also own shares of other corporations.</p>
<p>Some corporations make their customers the shareholders, such as co-operative banks or supermarkets. Usually, it will then be one vote per shareholder.</p>
<p>Because shares are contracts, they can be different: maybe some shares have no vote, maybe some shares pay no dividends.</p>
` },

    { topic: "Marxism",       level: 1,  title: "Bourgeois State", content: `
<p>Marxism sees a state (a government, courts, prisons, police, army) as a tool of the Bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>A state is made when there are different classes in society. Because the Proletariat and Bourgeoisie are different relationships with private property, a state is needed to keep private property safe.</p>
<p>Because private property is owned only by the Bourgeois classes, <u>a state is Bourgeois</u>.</p>
<p>Bourgeois states are against socialism because socialism is the Proletariat owning the means of production.</p>
` },

    { topic: "Marxism",       level: 1,  title: "Unions", content: `
<p><b>Unions</b> are the most natural way the proletariat fights the bourgeoisie. It is when workers say their demands (e.g. "We want more pay"), and will stop working ('strike') if employers do not give those demands.</p>
` },

    { topic: "Marxism",       level: 1,  title: "Fascism", content: `
<p>Fascism</p>
//The old consensus has therefore been shattered. The ruling class can no longer rule in the old way. The deeper the crisis, the more they are forced to ruthlessly attack the working class and take back the gains of the past. The capitalist system cannot any longer afford such “luxuries” as decent healthcare, education, pensions and welfare for working class people and their families. This, in turn, is provoking resentment and anger against the capitalist order. This explains the rise of so-called “populism”.
//In other words, capitalist democracy is really just the disguised dictatorship of the banks and monopolies. For them, this method of class rule is the most stable form of bourgeois state. So long as they are able to continue to rule by these means, the ruling class has no need to resort to fascism or open dictatorship.
//If the left don't step up as a revolutionary party, the right will
//Always exhausts and collapses
//Sees unions and workers' movements as in the way
