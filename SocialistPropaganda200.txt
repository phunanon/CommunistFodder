What Socialism Advocates
========================

Socialism is critical of private ownership of absentee property.
Example: someone owns two industrial machines. Unless they’re overly protective of their machines, or dim-witted, they’d rent out at least one. This makes them Bourgeois. By renting-out, they personally contribute nothing, controlling the relationship between machine operators and their tools. They own in absentia; they physically can’t use the machines personally.
In 1983 an average 26 minutes per hour across a wide range of UK industry was never paid back in wages. Subsequently, eight individuals own half of the world’s wealth. Not through sweat, but economic control. Not super-human abilities, but delegation and exploitation. Permanently underpaying workers results in mathematic inability to purchase all produce of capitalism—recession, debt and credit ensue. It’s farcical that we borrow our exploited money at interest to subsist.
We say: hold all absentee property in common! Ensure your neighbour has their home, the workman their hammer, the farmer their sickle. Who else needs these than the workers? Not lazy Bourgeois owners—ownership for rent is illegitimate! Can these bloodsuckers compete with a democratic workers’ economy in full harmony?
Away with irrational cock-fight markets, welcome rational competition and collaboration! Away with corrupt politicians, welcome people’s democracy!
